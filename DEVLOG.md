# Development Log

## Day 1 — Foundation & Architecture

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Focus:** Project scaffold, domain modeling, audit engine, landing page, testing

### What I built

1. **Project scaffold** — Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
2. **Domain types** — `AuditInput`, `AuditResult`, `Recommendation`, `ToolCatalogEntry`
3. **Pricing catalog** — 10 real AI tools with verified pricing from public pages
4. **Audit engine** — Deterministic analyzer: rightsizing, downgrades, credit matching
5. **Landing page** — Hero, value props, trust signals, CTA
6. **Spend form** — React Hook Form + Zod, dynamic tool entries, catalog-driven selects
7. **Results UI** — Summary cards, recommendation cards, methodology disclaimer
8. **Testing** — Vitest setup, 15+ tests covering catalog integrity and engine logic
9. **CI** — GitHub Actions: lint → typecheck → test → build
10. **Documentation** — All 12 root markdown files structured

### Key decisions

- **Client-side engine first**: No API needed for Day 1. The engine is pure functions — same code runs server-side later when we add Supabase.
- **Conservative savings**: Only flag downgrades when savings exceed 15% of current cost. We'd rather miss a small optimization than make a bad recommendation.
- **Real pricing data**: Not approximations. Every price has a public URL source and a verification date.
- **No auth**: Deliberately omitted. The product delivers value before asking anything.

### What I deferred

- Supabase integration (needs schema design)
- Email capture (comes after value delivery)
- PDF export
- AI summary
- Public share URLs
- Framer Motion animations

### Time spent

~3 hours of focused execution.

## Day 2 — Audit Engine Foundation

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Focus:** Pure calculation utilities, confidence scoring, overlap detection, PII sanitization

### What I built

1. **Calculations Library** — Extracted all math into pure, deterministic functions (`calculations.ts`)
2. **Confidence Scoring** — Objective factor-based system for high/medium/low trust signals (`confidence.ts`)
3. **Enhanced Analyzer** — Added consolidation logic (overlap detection) and "Keep" recommendations (`analyzer.ts`)
4. **Public Snapshot** — Built PII sanitization layer to prepare for shareable URLs (`snapshot.ts`)
5. **Catalog Expansion** — Added pricingModel, vendor, Google Gemini, and v0 by Vercel
6. **Results UI** — Added formula breakdowns, confidence badges, and overlap alerts
7. **Comprehensive Testing** — Scaled from 23 to 126 tests covering all engine logic

### Key decisions

- **Math transparency**: Every recommendation now includes a readable `formula` string.
- **Conservative consolidation**: We assume the cheapest tool is dropped when consolidating overlapping tools.
- **Factor-based confidence**: Instead of hardcoding confidence, we derive it from factors like pricing freshness and usage assumptions.

### Time spent

~2 hours.

## Day 3 — Backend Persistence & SaaS Execution

**Focus:** Supabase integration, Server/Client Boundaries, Premium UX

### What I built
1. **Supabase Integration**: Implemented strict Option A architecture using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` exclusively on the server.
2. **Server-Side Determinism**: `POST /api/audit` runs the engine on the server to prevent client-side manipulation.
3. **Public Snapshots**: Developed `/share/[slug]` pages using `nanoid` slugs, ensuring privacy for full audit results.
4. **Premium UX**: High-end visual upgrades including an Honest Empty State for zero-savings results.

## Day 4 — Lead Generation & Transactional Email

**Focus:** GenAI Summaries, Lead Capture, Resend Transactional Emails, Abuse Protection

### What I built
1. **AI Operations Summary**: Integrated `@google/genai` inside `/api/audit/[slug]/summary` with a resilient 4s `AbortController` and deterministic fallback text.
2. **Post-Value Lead Capture**: Developed a premium "Discuss these savings" CTA that securely saves to the `leads` table.
3. **Transactional Emails**: Integrated `resend` to trigger beautifully formatted, minimalist HTML emails (`src/lib/email/templates/audit-report.ts`) containing the AI summary and full savings breakdown.
4. **Graceful Degradation Boundaries**: Ensured `POST /api/lead` successfully records leads even if the email dispatch fails, returning a clean 201 response.
5. **Abuse Protection**: Implemented lightweight IP rate limiting and honeypot structures.

## Day 5 — Launch-Quality Polish & Premium Features

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Focus:** OG images, PDF export, AI summary performance, result page polish, SEO, mobile responsiveness

### What I built

1. **Dynamic OG Image Generation** — `src/app/share/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` renders premium dark-themed cards per audit using Next.js `ImageResponse`. Dominant annual savings number, minimal branding, catalog version footer.
2. **Dynamic Share Page Metadata** — Converted static metadata to `generateMetadata()` with per-audit title, description, OpenGraph, and Twitter Card tags.
3. **Dedicated Print/PDF Route** — `/share/[slug]/print` renders an isolated, investor-ready layout with: summary metrics, executive summary, all recommendations, generated timestamp, catalog version, engine version, and StackTrim methodology disclosure. Auto-triggers `window.print()` on mount.
4. **Result Page Polish** — Subtle Framer Motion entrance animations (fade-up, stagger). Skeleton loading for AI summary. Copy-to-clipboard share button with calm success feedback. PDF export button. Improved accessibility (`aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, `role` attributes).
5. **Premium Loading States** — `AuditLoading` component with phased progress messages ("Validating input data...", "Running audit engine...", "Detecting overlaps..."). Integrated into SpendForm during submission.
6. **AI Summary Performance** — `AbortController` with 8s client-side timeout. `Cache-Control` headers on summary API (cached: `max-age=3600`, fresh: `max-age=300`).
7. **Lead Capture Polish** — Calm emerald success state with check icon. No confetti. Improved form accessibility.
8. **SEO Optimization** — `metadataBase` for proper OG URL resolution. Title template (`%s — StackTrim`). JSON-LD structured data (`WebApplication` schema). Canonical URLs. Robots directives.
9. **Trust Messaging** — Share page footer: "Public links never expose private company details."
10. **Mobile Responsiveness** — Print view header/grid/footer stack vertically on small screens. Audit ID badge hidden on mobile. All cards responsive.
11. **Expanded Tests** — 153 tests (up from 132): OG metadata formatting (11), print formatting (10).

### Key decisions

- **Dedicated print route** over `window.print()` on main page: Cleaner separation, future-compatible with server-side PDF generation (Puppeteer/Chromium).
- **Named easing** (`"easeOut"`) over cubic bezier arrays: Framer Motion v12 strict tuple typing makes numeric arrays fail TypeScript.
- **Skeleton over spinner**: Perceived performance dramatically better with content-shaped placeholders.
- **Zero new dependencies**: Everything built with existing stack (framer-motion, next/og, lucide-react).
- **Ramp/Mercury aesthetic**: All animations are subtle, finance-appropriate, and never flashy.

### Architecture observations

- **Dual DB call on share pages**: `generateMetadata()` and the page component both call `createAdminClient()`. Next.js deduplication doesn't apply to Supabase SDK (only raw `fetch`). Acceptable at current scale; could optimize with React `cache()` wrapper if needed.
- **Print page is "use client"**: Required for `useEffect` auto-print trigger. Could potentially be a server component with a client-side print button instead, but current approach is simpler.
- **OG image uses inline types**: Inlined snapshot type instead of importing `PublicAuditSnapshot` to keep the OG image route self-contained and avoid edge runtime issues.

### Day-5 Stabilization Pass

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| `npm run lint` | ✅ Zero errors |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | ✅ Zero errors |
| `npm test` | ✅ 153 tests |
| `npm run build` | ✅ Clean production build |

**Route map (post-build):**
- `○ /` — Static landing
- `○ /audit` — Static form
- `ƒ /api/audit` — Dynamic (POST)
- `ƒ /api/audit/[slug]/summary` — Dynamic (GET)
- `ƒ /api/lead` — Dynamic (POST)
- `ƒ /share/[slug]` — Dynamic (SSR + OG)
- `ƒ /share/[slug]/print` — Dynamic (SSR + auto-print)
- `ƒ /share/-/opengraph-image` — Dynamic (OG image gen)

### Remaining technical debt

1. **Dual Supabase query** on share pages (metadata + page). Low priority — marginal performance impact.
2. **No E2E tests** for the full audit → lead → email journey. Playwright recommended for Day-6+.
3. **No loading state for share page SSR**. Next.js streaming handles this, but a custom `loading.tsx` could improve perceived quality.
4. **Print CSS uses inline `<style>` tag**. Works, but could be extracted to globals.css `@media print` block for cleanliness.
5. **formatCurrency duplicated** across 4 files (audit-results, print-audit-view, opengraph-image, share page). Could extract to shared utility. Low priority.

### Day-6 prerequisites

- All quality gates green ✅
- Production build clean ✅
- Architecture documented ✅
- No blocking issues
- Ready for: analytics integration, benchmark dashboards, or domain verification

### Time spent

~3 hours.
